	The go mod init command creates a go.mod file to track 
your code's dependencies.



	So far, the file includes only the name of your module
and the Go version your code supports. 
	But as you add dependencies, the go.mod file will list the
versions your code depends on. This keeps builds reproducible and 
gives you direct control over which module versions to use.
